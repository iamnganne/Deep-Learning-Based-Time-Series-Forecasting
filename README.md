# Deep Learning Based Time Series Forecasting
Time series forecasting is a critical task in numerous fields, including finance, supply chain management, and energy demand planning. To enhance forecasting accuracy, hybrid models that combine the strengths of multiple architectures have gained significant attention.
## üìå Objectives
- This project explores a hybrid approach by integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, known for their ability to capture sequential dependencies, with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), renowned for feature extraction capabilities.
- The model leverages CNNs to extract meaningful patterns from input data and LSTMs to model temporal relationships, resulting in improved predictive performance.
- Compare models based on metrics such as RMSE,MSE,MAE
- Build an interactive GUI using Streamlit
## üß† Model Implemented
